# Deep Reinforcement Learning-based content migration

This package code contains implimentation of the main body of Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Content Migration (DRLCM).
The code structure is inspired from "BinPacking_Neural_Combinatorial_Optimization"
Model built by Ruben Solozabal. Readers are encourged to first get familiar with DRL based binpacking simulation code 
as DRLCM is a dynamic and more complex model.

# Requirements 

- Python 3.0
- Tensorflow 1.14.0

# Results

The performance of the DRLCM is compared to 5 LRU-based content placements
[please refer to the manuscript]


**DRLCM Performance obtained is over 70%.**
